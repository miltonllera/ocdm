# Object-centric disentangled mechanisms

This repository contains code for the final chapter of my PhD thesis. Said chapter deals with the compositional generalisation capabilities of Object Centric models, specifically Slot Attention. Additionally, it can be used to reproduce the results in the other chapters, though there are no scripts provided to do so.
